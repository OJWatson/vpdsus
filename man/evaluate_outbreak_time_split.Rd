\title{Time-aware outbreak model evaluation with plots}
\usage{
evaluate_outbreak_time_split(
  data,
  train_end = NULL,
  threshold = 0.5,
  n_bins = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Modelling panel from \code{\link[=make_modelling_panel]{make_modelling_panel()}}.}

\item{train_end}{Last year included in training. If \code{NULL}, chooses a cutoff
that holds out at least one distinct year.}

\item{threshold}{Classification threshold for \code{pred_outbreak}.}

\item{n_bins}{Number of bins for the calibration plot.}
}
\value{
List with components \code{metrics} (single-row tibble), \code{predictions}
(test-set tibble with probabilities), and \code{plots} (ggplot objects).
}
\description{
Fits the baseline outbreak model on an early-year training set and evaluates
it on later years.
