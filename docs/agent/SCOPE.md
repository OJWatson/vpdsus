# Scope

This repository is being redeveloped to provide an end-to-end workflow for vaccine-preventable disease susceptibility estimation and downstream risk scanning / modelling.

In-scope (see specification):
- Offline-friendly package layer (functions + vignettes)
- Data discovery and access helpers
- Panel building
- Multiple susceptibility estimation methods
- WHO-style ranking outputs
- Outbreak modelling workflows
- Mechanistic (SIRV) susceptibility inference using odin2/dust2

Out-of-scope:
- Any workflow that requires live network access within package vignettes.
